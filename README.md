(i) This is my first machine learning script for predicting house prices based on house dataset information from Ames, Iowa. 

(ii) Download the Jupyter notebook (my_first_ML.ipynb) and the test dataset (test.csv) and the training dataset (train.csv) and run the notebook; it will produce four submission files (predicted house prices using the test dataset); these are the files that I submitted to Kaggle. 

(iii) The machine learning models will be highly refined and a new script (my_refined_ML.ipynb) will be released soon.

(iv) I have also uploaded a short PowerPoint presentation (Housing_prices.pptx); the material is light (not very detailed) as it is meant to provide a snapshotof the modeling process.

(v) Send me an email if you have any questions/suggestions: r.attafynn@gmail.com
