This is my first machine learning script for predicting house prices based on house dataset information from Ames, Iowa. 

Download the Jupyter notebook (my_first_ML.inpy) and the test dataset (test.csv) and the training dataset (train.csv) and run the notebook.

I have also uploaded a short PowerPoint presentation (Housing_prices.pptx); the material is light as it is meant to provide a snapshotof the modeling process.
